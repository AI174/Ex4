1. Classes in the trees package:
    a)Fruit Class: represents a fruit object in the game world, It creat a fruit with the asked effects
    also this class handle the collision with the avatar (change its color).

    b)Leaf Class: represents a leaf object in the game world, It creat a leaf with the asked effects
     (turns around itself 90 degree).

    c)Trunk Class: represents a trunk object in the game world, It creat a static trunk
     with the asked effects (change its color).

    d)Flora Class: represents a flora in the game world, including trees, leaves, and fruits.
    it handles all the above classes and creates them (a-c).

2. Connections between classes:
   The Flora Class uses all the classes above (Fruit,Leaf,Trunk) in order to represent the flora game object
    thus the relation is Dependency.

3. Used Design Pattern:
    We used the Observer design pattern in order to establish a relationship between the avatar (subject)
    and the Fruit,Leaf,Trunk (observers), In order to update the observers when the avatar jumps.
    As asked in the exercise we make specific effect when the avatar jumps.
